##INTRODUCTION

Are you a module or theme developer? Have you created several modules or theme
and you want to see them all in one place? Probably not. But if you, for some
reason need to display a number of downloads for a list of module(s) and/or
theme(s) then you should try out this module. Projects stats provides a block,
which displays a table with project names and downloads count for selected
modules and/or themes.

##REQUIREMENTS

None.

##INSTALLATION

1. Install module as usual via Drush or Drupal UI
2. Go to "Extend" and enable the Projects stats module.

##USING THE MODULE

After you install the module, go to the block layout 'admin/structure/block' and
add a 'Projects stats' block. After you click 'Place block' button, you will see
a number of options. You need to enter machine names of project you want to
display in your block, and there are several more options like cache age for
block, sort type and table classes. Every block has it's own settings, so you
can have multiple blocks that show different list of projects.
